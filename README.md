# Todo Application

New flutter project

## Description

This is the second project I've done using Flutter. I have utilized stateful widgets for the first time. Since I lack some basic knowledge in Dart itself, I have decided to leave some functionalities in the app (adding new tasks, search bar, etc)

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
